# Constraints

Constraints are a way to control an object’s properties (e.g. its location, rotation, scale).
There are two main types of constrains:
* Static constrains - plain constant values (A.K.A "limit" constrains).
* Dynamic constrains - dynamic values that are retrieved from another object, called “target” (A.K.A "copy" constrains).

Constraints can be applied to Objects and Bones, and they work in combination with each other to form a Constraint Stack.
