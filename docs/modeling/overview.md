# Overview

Modeling is simply the art and science of creating a surface that mimics the shape of a real-world object. Although it is not mandatory to model a robot in order to animate your robot, it is extremely helpful to see the robot model when you simulate it.

In this section we will cover basic robot modeling and robot model parts importing from other 3D CAD software such as Fusion 360.

You can read more about modeling in the official Blender [documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/index.html).
